Purpose: to create an app using JavaScript that will take an input of a Latin hexameter line and output that line with color-coding to indicate correctly the lengths of that line's syllables (i.e., to scan the line correctly).

Goals:
1. Use ReactJS for rendering.

Notes:
1. Use dark-tone color for long syllables and light-tone for short.
2. Mark with red a line that the app can't scan properly (if necessary).
